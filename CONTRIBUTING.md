üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Bestjobs and its packages, which are hosted in the Bestjobs on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## How to contribute to Bestjobs

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Bestjobs**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://bestjobs.github.io/security.html).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/bestjobs/bestjobs.github.io/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bestjobs/bestjobs.github.io/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Active Record** (models, database) issues](https://bestjobs.github.io/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_master.rb)
  * [**Action Pack** (controllers, routing) issues](https://bestjobs.github.io/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_master.rb)
  * [**Generic template** for other issues](https://bestjobs.github.io/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/generic_master.rb)

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://bestjobs.github.io/contributing-to-bestjobs.html).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Bestjobs](https://bestjobs.github.io/contributing-to-bestjobs.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Bestjobs will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://bestjobs.github.io/contributing-to-bestjobs.html)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [bestjobs-core mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Bestjobs in the [bestjobs-talk mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Bestjobs documentation?**

* Please read [Contributing to the Bestjobs Documentation](https://bestjobs.github.io/contributing-to-bestjobs.html).
